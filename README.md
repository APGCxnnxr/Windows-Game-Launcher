**IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO DOWNLOAD THE LATEST PYTHON FROM THE MICROSOFT STORE!!!** **You also may need Visual Code if you can't edit the Python with Windows Notepad.**
# Windows-Game-Launcher
This is a custom Game launcher I made in Python. It's simple to make your own, with your own games. 


**_How to Add your Games Into the Launcher_**
1. Add download the python code file,and make a folder somewhere you can remember, and is easy to type the directory path. (examples of areas to put it: Documents, desktop, somewhere in your users 

2.In the folder, add a folder called "Games"

3.Add the game (.exe) or Internet shortcut/shortcut file into the 

4.In the Games folder, add a folder called " Icons " 

5. Add the example icon image into the folder

6. Go to the python and open it with notepad, so you can change the directory of the files.

**Things to change:**
Insert the directory like this inside the quotations: C:\Where\ever\the\files\are\in\your\pc\drive

Example: 
ICONS_FOLDER = r"C:\ThisPC\Users\me\Documents\GameLauncher\Games\Icons"
     
     
     GAMES_FOLDER = r""
     ICONS_FOLDER = r""
     FALLBACK_ICON_PATH = r"" # Fallback image
     HOVER_SOUND_PATH = r""
     LAUNCH_SOUND_PATH = r"

8. Download the sound Files, and make sure they are named, hover.wav , or launch.wav , or they wont work.

9. After changing the directory of everything, if nothing works after double clicking the .py file, and you have the python downloaded from te Microsoft store, download Visual Code, and the Python extension, as you need to install the dependencies and packages for it to run. ( I know this because after I did this with my test subject (my friend } it worked.)

 ** Coming soon, I forgot what the packages are because it's a few.**
